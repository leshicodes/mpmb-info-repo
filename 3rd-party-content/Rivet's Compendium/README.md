## Spell Descriptions

### Rivet's Voltic Conflagration
*3rd-level evocation*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a copper coil wrapped around a quartz crystal)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a charged lightning burst from your Lightning Launcher, which arcs toward a target before detonating in a 15-foot radius electromagnetic surge. Instead of an explosive shockwave, this releases a high-voltage discharge that briefly overloads nervous systems and mechanical constructs.

- Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
- On a failure: They take 6d6 lightning damage and are unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn.
- On a success: They take half damage and suffer no secondary effect.
- Creatures wearing metal armor or made of metal have disadvantage on the save.
- Constructs & magically-powered machines that fail the save are also stunned for 1 round due to the electromagnetic interference.

**At Higher Levels:** When cast at 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 per level and the radius increases by 5 feet per two levels above 3rd.

### Rivet's Fractured Step
*4th-level illusion*  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of planar glass worth 50 gp, which is consumed)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body phases in and out of localized dimensional rifts, causing you to momentarily exist in multiple places at once. This makes you appear as a glitching afterimage, flickering unpredictably between realities. Upon casting, choose **one** of the following effects:

- **Distorted Presence:** Attack rolls against you have disadvantage unless the attacker can see into the Ethereal Plane.
- **Dimensional Slip:** When you take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action, you briefly flicker into an adjacent dimension, turning fully invisible until the start of your next turn.
- **Planar Jitter:** When an enemy misses an attack against you, you can use your reaction to teleport up to 15 feet in any direction as you flicker between locations.
- **Afterimage Misdirection:** When you make a Stealth check, you create a phantom duplicate for 1 round. If an enemy targets your location before their next turn, roll a 1d4:
  - 1-2: They hit the duplicate, wasting their attack.
  - 3-4: They see through it and attack normally.

## Design Notes

These spells are intended to reflect Rivet's background as an Artificer/Rogue who specializes in manipulating electrical energy and dimensional space. They combine elements from traditional artificer crafting with the trickery and evasiveness of a rogue.

The Voltic Conflagration draws inspiration from traditional area-of-effect spells like Fireball, but with a specialized effect against constructs and a secondary effect that fits within the power level of 3rd-level spells.

The Fractured Step provides mobility and defensive options consistent with 4th-level illusion magic, while requiring concentration as a balancing factor.
