Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.\n   The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.\n   The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.\n   In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.\n   Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).\n   The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.\n   Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes this effect permanent."},SpellsList["tenser's transformation"]={name:"Tenser's Transformation",classes:["wizard"],source:[["X",168]],level:6,school:"Trans",time:"1 a",range:"Self",components:"V,S,M",compMaterial:"A few hairs from a bull",duration:"Conc, 10 min",description:"50 temp HP; prof Str/Con save, all wea/arm; extra atk; adv., wea atks +2d12 Force dmg; no spellc.",descriptionShorter:"50 temp HP; prof Str/Con save, wea/arm; +1 atk; adv, wea atks +2d12 Force dmg; no spellc",descriptionFull:"You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic.

The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\n   This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n   The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8+2 charges.\n   >>Power Strike<<.

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: Cone of Cold (5 charges), Fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), Globe of Invulnerability (6 charges), Hold Monster (5 charges), Levitate (2 charges). Lightning Bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), Magic Missile (1 charge), Ray of Enfeeblement (1 charge), or Wall of Force (5 charges).\n   >>Retributive Strike<<. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n   You have a 50% chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\n>>Distance from Origin\tEffect<<\n10 ft. away or closer\t8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away\t6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away\t4 × the number of charges in the staff\n\n\n   >>Animate Walking Statues<<. You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\n   >>Dispel Magic<<. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast Dispel Magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\n   >>Drain Magic<<. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\n   >>Master of Enchantment<<. When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\n   >>Sentience<<. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\n   >>Personality<<. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\n   In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\n   >>Spirit Trap<<. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\n   Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes.

The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.","While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.","Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.",">>Freeing Gargauth<<. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil.

Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.","A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace.","Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.",">>Hellish Currency<<.

A hoard item in its Slumbering state has certain base properties, and it gains additional properties when it enters the Stirring (young dragon), Wakened (adult dragon), or Ascendant (ancient dragon) state.","Ordinarily, a hoard item must steep in a dragon's hoard for 1 year to reach the maximum possible state allowed by the age of the hoard's dragon.

STAGE ONE CORRUPTION: BEGINNINGS","Once a character has attuned to a cursed infernal magic item or artifact, it begins the infernal corruption process. Each time that character finishes a long rest, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom save (tieflings have advantage on this save). On a success, the character suffers no effects, but the DC increases by 1 the next time they must make this save. On a failure, the character progresses to Stage Two unless Dispel Evil and Good is cast on them before their next long rest.","   While in Stage One, the infernal corruption can be prevented by breaking attunement to the corrupting item. This prevents further Wisdom saves and resets the DC of the save, if the character were to attune to the item again.","","2. STAGE TWO CORRUPTION: SUFFERINGS","While in Stage Two, the character becomes delusional, seeing plots against them where there are none. Additionally, each time they rest, they experience terrifying visions and infernal whispers. Whenever they finish a long rest, they take 1d12 necrotic damage, which ignores resistances and immunities and can't be healed until a Dispel Evil and Good or Remove Curse spell is cast on them. Once the character has taken this damage six times, they progress to Stage Three.","   While in Stage Two, the infernal corruption can be removed with one of the following spells: Divine Word, Heal, Mass Heal, True Polymorph, True Resurrection, or Wish.","\n3. STAGE THREE CORRUPTION: DEPARTINGS","While in Stage Three, the character begins to suffer physical transformation, and slowly embraces evil. After they finish their first long rest upon entering Stage Three they must roll on the table below to determine how the infernal curse starts shaping them into a devil. In addition, a part-devil character is rendered infertile and detects as a Fiend to Detect Evil and Good spells and similar magic.","","   d10\tTransformation","     1\tTheir fingertips elongate into claws","     2\tNon-functional leathery wings sprout from their back","     3\tDevilish horns grow upon their head","     4\tEach night more and more of their skin burns, leaving charred patches","     5\tOne eye turns milky white, the other turns yellow","     6\tTheir spine painfully elongates into a skeletal tail","     7\tTheir skin starts to calcify, turning portions into bone","     8\tTheir feet painfully twist to resemble cloven hooves","     9\tAll their hair falls out, replaced by tiny spikes","   10\tAll their teeth fall out, with new jagged teeth tearing through the gums each morning","","The character begins to experience waking whispers pushing them towards evil and they suffer terrifying visions whenever they rest, breaking their spirit and pushing them further to evil. Each time they finish a short or long rest, they must make a DC 10 Wisdom save. If they performed at least one evil act, such as making a decision that increased the suffering of others, they make the save with disadvantage. When they fail the save, they progress to Stage Four.","   While in Stage Three, the infernal corruption can be ended with one of the following spells: True Polymorph, True Resurrection or Wish.","","4. STAGE FOUR CORRUPTION: FINALITIES","When the character finishes their first long rest after reaching Stage Four, the character's alignment shifts to lawful evil. They're now bound by the devil's code, requiring them to honor any pact made and acquire souls in service of Asmodeus. Lastly, their physical form changes, morphing to resemble a devil (DM's choice).","   Once the character reaches Stage Four, the only two cures are the Wish spell, which counts as beyond the scope of the spell, or by signing an infernal contract with Asmodeus to reclaim their soul."].join("\n")}],description:"\n   "+toUni("Corrupting")+'.
