At least one of my chosen inventions must be a major invention. I immediately gain the gadgets without expending the resources, having been assumed to have been working on them for some time. Some gadgets require a saving throw called my Gadget DC, and it is equal to 8 + my proficiency bonus + my Intelligence modifier. I learn how to craft an additional gadget of my choice at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. A major invention is a gadget which is either permanent, or a single use consumable. If they were used, consumable major gadgets replenish after a long rest, at no cost. A minor invention is a consumable gadget that I have a handful of at any given time. For each minor gadget I know how to make, I have a number of equal to half my Intelligence modifier rounded up (minimum 1). Minor gadgets replenish up to this maximum limit after a long rest, at no cost. During a short rest, I may create one minor gadget of a type of my choosing, up to my maximum at no cost, but may not work on anything else during this time. Minor Gadgets beyond my free limit may be created, taking 1 hour of work and 100 gp of supplies per additional gadget created. If the gadget is an arrow, it is fired normally from a bow and deals its regular damage in addition to any listed effects. If I miss with an arrow, its effect is still consumed on impact. Arrows can be substituted with bolts for a crossbow, and weigh the same as normal ammunition. It takes an Investigation check against my Gadget DC to tell that these are non-standard arrows or bolts.",

Upon landing, I take no damage and the chute flops down behind me. As an action I can pull a cord again and stuff it back into the pack. If I'm about to be hit with a melee or ranged attack, I may pull the chute as a reaction, orienting it towards the attack’s origin. The parachute bursts out and detaches from the pack, intercepting and preventing the attack, but will be damaged and need repair. Additionally, if the source of the attack was within 15 ft, the attacker is restrained and blinded by the parachute wrapped around them. A target restrained and blinded by the parachute may take an action to free themselves and end the effects. The parachute has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points. If the parachute hits 0 hit points, I fall, but only take half of the damage from the fall, and the parachute will require a repair. If the parachute is damaged, I repair it after a long rest. If I need to repair it sooner, it requires 2 hours of work, and 50 gp in supplies. The parachute pack weighs 15 lbs. When extended and inflated by air, the parachute takes up a 10 foot cube of space directly above me.\n     Advanced: My rate of descent is slowed to 30 ft per round, and I may control my lateral movement, moving up to 40 ft per round in a direction of my choice. I can control the glider using one or both free hands, and descend straight down.

The parachute now has 20 AC and 40 hit points. As an action, I may increase the potency of the alchemical lift, allowing me to negate my descent, or even climb by up to 10 ft per round. This increase lasts for 1 minute, after which, I begin to descend as normal. I replenish my alchemical lift formula after a long rest.

On a short rest, I may opt to repair one key, but I may not work on anything else during this time.

As a bonus action, I can press either side of the coin in a special way and the dagger seemingly materializes into my hand. A creature trying to discern if the coin is something more, must succeed on an Investigation check against my Gadget DC. To return it to coin shape, I must spend a minute carefully packing it back into the spring loaded form. Creating additional coin blades is a highly intensive process, and it takes 24 hours of work, and 250 gp in supplies, and the dagger weighs 0.2 lbs.\n     Advanced: The blade now counts as a magical +1 weapon, and it is impossible to tell that it is not a coin when folded, without physically opening it using the trigger action.\n     Masterwork: The blade improves to a magical +2 weapon. Additionally, once I’ve attuned to it, I can never lose it, as it will always find its way back to my hands. The coin has also taken on the eerie ability to predict favourable outcomes. Ask the coin a yes or no question, or present it a binary decision, labelling the outcomes to either heads or tails, and flip the coin. The coin always seems to come up on the more favourable option.",

Note that some surfaces may not allow the hook to stick.

Additionally, as an Action, I may aim the Longshot at a loose object or creature smaller than me within 30 ft.

It has the same stats as a spider, but counts as a construct instead of a beast. The mechanid understands the commands I give it and will follow my commands to the best of its ability. While it is within 100 ft of me, as an action on each of my turns I can control it remotely using a small handheld device. While controlling the mechanid, I may see and hear as if I were the spider, although I count as deaf and blind for my own body if I do so. I may only have one mechanid active at a time. Each additional one after the first takes 24 hours of work and 250 gp in materials to craft. If my mechanid is damaged or destroyed, I may repair it after only 1 hour of work and 25 gp in supplies.

Additionally, it gains the ability to produce webbing, to allow for hanging from objects, or to layer on the ground to detect passing creatures.

Upon landing, I take no damage and the chute flops down behind me. As an action I can pull a cord again and stuff it back into the pack. If I'm about to be hit with a melee or ranged attack, I may pull the chute as a reaction, orienting it towards the attack’s origin. The parachute bursts out and detaches from the pack, intercepting and preventing the attack, but will be damaged and need repair. Additionally, if the source of the attack was within 15 ft, the attacker is restrained and blinded by the parachute wrapped around them. A target restrained and blinded by the parachute may take an action to free themselves and end the effects. The parachute has an AC of 10 and 20 hit points. If the parachute hits 0 hit points, I fall, but only take half of the damage from the fall, and the parachute will require a repair. If the parachute is damaged, I repair it after a long rest. If I need to repair it sooner, it requires 2 hours of work, and 50 gp in supplies. The parachute pack weighs 15 lbs. When extended and inflated by air, the parachute takes up a 10 foot cube of space directly above me.\n     Advanced: My rate of descent is slowed to 30 ft per round, and I may control my lateral movement, moving up to 40 ft per round in a direction of my choice. I can control the glider using one or both free hands, and descend straight down. The weight is reduced to 8 lbs and the parachute now has 15 AC and 30 hit points.\n     Masterwork: The rate of descent is slowed to 10 ft per round, and the speed of my lateral movement improves to 60 ft per round. The parachute now has 20 AC and 40 hit points. As an action, I may increase the potency of the alchemical lift, allowing me to negate my descent, or even climb by up to 10 ft per round. This increase lasts for 1 minute, after which, I begin to descend as normal. I replenish my alchemical lift formula after a long rest.

If I fail the check, the spring loaded mechanism breaks and requires a repair before it can be used again. I repair one Skeleton Key automatically on a long rest. On a short rest, I may opt to repair one key, but I may not work on anything else during this time. Due to the many small and fragile mechanisms, it is time consuming and expensive to replace or duplicate this device, taking 8 hours of work and 250 gp of supplies. This device does not help with combination style locks, barred doors, or anything without a keyhole.\n     Advanced: On a failed check to open a lock, the device no longer breaks or needs repair, and the device may be used on magical locks without advantage. Additionally, I have advantage on all checks made to conceal the key on my person from another creature. Finally, I may use the device to see through a keyhole, and see the room beyond as if I were crouched at the doorway with the door open.
